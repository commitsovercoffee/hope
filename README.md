# Hope

![](hope.png)

Hope (Highly Optimised Productivity Environment) is a collection of scripts and dotfiles for my ever-evolving Arch setup. It installs the base system, configures essential settings, and installs all the apps I use, including their respective configs, recreating my exact workflow environment on any machine in no time.

You can follow below steps to replicate my arch setup. Or fork it & make your own thing.

## Pre-requisites

- [ ] Confirm Your CPU & GPU both are from [team red](https://www.amd.com/en.html).
- [ ] Realize that the script will [wipe](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope/blob/301e5b76593e0f921a531058d802f506ce01bd4d/install.sh#L21) your first NVMe SSD.
- [ ] (Optional) Prepare emotionally. You may cry later if you didnâ€™t read the line above.

## Usage

- Grab the arch ISO from [here](https://archlinux.org/download/).
- Create a bootable USB using [recommended methods](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/USB_flash_installation_medium).
- Boot in UEFI mode with [Secure Boot Disabled](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Unified_Extensible_Firmware_Interface/Secure_Boot#Disabling_Secure_Boot).
- Connect to the internet via ethernet or wifi (with [iwctl](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Iwd#Connect_to_a_network)).
- Run below command from a live arch environment :

```bash
pacman -Sy git;
git clone https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/hope.git;
bash ./hope/install.sh;
```

Once the installation is complete, your system will automatically reboot.

## Post Install

- Log in with the username "hope" and the password you set during setup.
- Feel frustrated that the default DWM keymaps don't work as expected.
- Look up my custom [keymaps](https://github.com/commitsovercoffee/dwm-remix/blob/18ea6642abae18e1c79c3359b02ee5e538a2a53a/config.def.h#L113).
- Live happily ever after.

## Status

This setup is my daily driver. I update it whenever I find something useful or need to fix a bug.
